# Overview

I recently developed a currency converter application using JavaScript to deepen my understanding of the language and its practical application in web development. The software allows users to convert between different currencies based on real-time exchange rates fetched from an API.

My goal with this project was to enhance my proficiency in JavaScript syntax, particularly focusing on DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming with fetch, error handling, and local storage usage for maintaining conversion history.

# Development Environment

For this project, I utilized a standard web development environment. I relied on Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor for its robust features and extensions that facilitate efficient coding practices.

JavaScript served as the core programming language for client-side scripting, leveraging the browser's Fetch API to fetch exchange rates dynamically from the ExchangeRate-API.

# Future Work

- To provide support for additional currencies and implement user preferences for customizing conversion settings.
- To implement a feature for historical exchange rate data visualization, allowing users to track currency trends over time.
